# Advanced Usage

Advanced techniques for using **mp-units** in sophisticated scenarios beyond standard
quantity calculations.

## Available Guides

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
- [Pure Dimensional Analysis](pure_dimensional_analysis.md) - Use dimensions without specific units for symbolic computation, compile-time validation, and custom arithmetic types
- [Type-Safe Indices and Offsets](typed_indices.md) - Model container indices and offsets as quantities with point origins, covering 0-based vs 1-based indexing, SI vs IEC element prefixes, and stride arithmetic

## When to Use These Guides?

Use these advanced techniques when you:

- Need dimensional analysis without actual quantity values
- Build symbolic computation or automatic differentiation systems
- Validate dimensional consistency at compile-time
- Work with template metaprogramming involving dimensions
- Implement custom arithmetic types with dimensional correctness
